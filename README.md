## What is this project

This is going to be a 3D Renderer written from scratch in C/C++ (so far). This is a playground for me to learn about 3D rendering, but also experiment in regard of my programming style.

### Why starting something from scratch?! This might be too much work.

There are multiple reason for that: 

First of all: it's helping with **my learning process**. I need to have a "hand-on" new concepts for me to understand them. Since I want to have a full understanding of everything that is going on in a renderer (not only the 3D part but also everything that goes into engineering a "quality" piece of software), I decided to make everything myself.

The second reason is that **I want to figure out my programming style, my programming personality**. We all know that programmers easily falls into fanaticism, with OOP zealots, FP zealots, the-old-way-was-better zealots. I believe everyone writting code has its own way of expressing itself. Not only that, I also believe it is the single most important marker for software quality (It's a belief, but so far, we don't have much more than that in the programming world). This subject deserves an article on its own, I might write one in the future.

The last reason is: **it can be used as resource for others like me**. Hopefully this project is going to help someone one way or another. I will try to make clear "releases", with a clear explanation of what happened in between releases: my success, failures, choices whether it is purely technical or touching to programming style.



### Where this project is going to go

I don't know where this is going. I hope I am going to continue working on it for a while, this is going to be my playground for tackling new topic that interest me.
